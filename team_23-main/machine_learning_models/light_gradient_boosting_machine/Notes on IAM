WARNING: The role [roles/cloudfunctions.invoker] was successfully bound to member [allUsers] but this does not grant the member permission to invoke 2nd gen function [train_lgbm]. Instead, the role [roles/run.invoker] must be granted on the underlying Cloud Run service. This can be done by running the `gcloud functions add-invoker-policy-binding` command.

Would you like to run this command and additionally grant [allUsers] permission to invoke function [train_lgbm] (Y/n)?  y

The role [roles/run.invoker] was successfully bound to the underlying Cloud Run service. You can view its IAM policy by running:
